# What is prompt adhearence

ChatGPT said:
Prompt Adherence in CrewAI refers to how strictly an agent follows the provided instructions, constraints, and structure of the prompt when executing a task. It determines whether the agent should stick closely to the given guidance or have some flexibility in interpreting it.

How It Works in CrewAI
In CrewAI, prompt adherence can be controlled using different settings when defining agents or tasks. Some tasks might require strict adherence (e.g., structured reports with exact formats), while others might allow for more creativity.

Example Use Case
Imagine you have an agent writing news summaries. If prompt adherence is high, the agent will strictly follow the expected format and length. If prompt adherence is low, the agent might summarize the news more freely, potentially deviating from the format.

based off of that, please create me a prompt generator that  you feel would work best in an ai agent framework like crewai.

Prompt Generator for AI Agents in CrewAI
A good prompt generator for CrewAI should:
âœ… Allow flexibility for different agent roles
âœ… Support different levels of prompt adherence
âœ… Ensure clear instructions, constraints, and goals

Here's a Python script that dynamically generates structured prompts based on agent roles, goals, and adherence levels:

    ```python

    import random

    class AIPromptGenerator:
        def __init__(self, role, goal, task, adherence="medium"):
            """
            Initializes the prompt generator.
            
            :param role: The role of the AI agent (e.g., "Researcher", "Writer").
            :param goal: The agent's main objective.
            :param task: The specific task assigned.
            :param adherence: How strictly the agent should follow the prompt (low, medium, high).
            """
            self.role = role
            self.goal = goal
